    "- We overload common operators such as `__add__`, `__sub__`, `__mul__`, and `__truediv__` and their commutative pairs `__radd__`, `__rsub__`, `__rmul__`, and `__rtruediv__`.\n",
    "    - The basic rules for derivatives of multiplication and division are applied:\n",
    "    $$\\frac{d[u(x)\\cdot v(x)]}{dx}=u'(x)\\cdot v(x)+u(x)\\cdot v'(x)$$\n",
    "    $$\\frac{d\\left[\\frac{u(x)}{v(x)}\\right]}{dx}=\\frac{u'(x)\\cdot v(x)-u(x)\\cdot v'(x)}{v^2(x)}$$\n",
    "- We overload unary operator `__neg__`\n",
    "- We also overload `__pow__` and `__rpow__`. We implement them as the general form below:\n",
    "    $$f(x)=\\left[u(x)\\right]^{v(x)}$$\n",

    "    - Therefore when we implement the derivatives, including the very special case such as $y=x^x$, the following chain rule applies:\n",

    "        - $y=2^x-3x^5$\n",

    "    - `arcsin(x)`, `arccos(x)`, `arctan(x)`, `arccot(x)`, `arcsec(x)`, `arccsc(x)`: essentially we only need to implement `arcsin(x)` and all other anti-trigonometric functions can be derived from `arcsin(x)`. For example: $\\arctan(x)=\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1+x^2}}\\right)$.\n",
